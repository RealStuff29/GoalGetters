## üí° Business Problem

Many students find it difficult to stay consistent, focused, and motivated when working toward their goals. They often have friends, but not the right peers who can help keep them accountable. Existing social or productivity applications do not effectively combine peer accountability with privacy and flexibility. Students need a simple and safe way to find others with similar goals and motivation levels who can support them in maintaining discipline and progress.
  
> **GoalGetters** solves this by pairing/connecting students with anonymous like-minded partners who share similar objectives, ensuring both privacy and productivity at the same time.

## Developers Setup Guide

Comprehensive steps to help other developers or evaluators run and test your project.

---

### 0) Prerequisites
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) v2.4+  
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v18+ and npm v9+  
- Access to backend or cloud services used (Firebase, MongoDB Atlas, AWS S3, etc.)

---

### 1) Download the Project
```bash
git clone https://github.com/RealStuff29/GoalGetters.git
cd GoalGetters
npm install
```

---

### 2) Configure Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following structure:

```bash
VITE_SUPABASE_URL= .env.example
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY= .env.example
```

> Never commit the `.env` file to your repository.  
> Instead, include a `.env.example` file with placeholder values.

---

### 3) Backend / Cloud Service Setup

#### Supabase (To Do: Need to edit this part)
1. Go to [Supabase Console](https://supabase.com/)
2. Create a new project.
3. Enable the following:
   - **Authentication** ‚Üí Email/Password sign-in
   - **Supabase Database**
   - **Hosting (optional)** if you plan to deploy your web app
4. Copy the Supabase configuration into your `.env` file.

<!-- #### Optional: Express.js / MongoDB
If your app includes a backend:
1. Create a `/server` folder for backend code.
2. Inside `/server`, create a `.env` file with:
   ```bash
   MONGO_URI=<your_mongodb_connection_string>
   JWT_SECRET=<your_jwt_secret_key>
   ```
3. Start the backend:
   ```bash
   cd server
   npm install
   npm start
   ```

--- -->

### 4) Run the Frontend
To start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```
The project will run on [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) by default.

To build and preview the production version:
```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

| Responsiveness | Test on mobile & desktop | Layout adjusts without distortion |
| Navigation | All menu links functional | Pages route correctly |
| Error Handling | Invalid inputs or missing data | User-friendly error messages displayed |
